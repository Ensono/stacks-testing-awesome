|  12/10/2019 | Upgrading a create-react-app project to a SSR + code splitting setup | Since its inception, create-react-app is a great tool for rapidly prototyping React apps, demos and testing different features or techniques. That was, and still is, the main idea behind it. | https://medium.com/bucharestjs/upgrading-a-create-react-app-project-to-a-ssr-code-splitting-setup-9da57df2040a |
